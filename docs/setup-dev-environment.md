Kaltura Player RN SDK gives the media playback, VR/360 media playback and Offline media playback(Not Supported Currently). If you want to use other plugins like IMA, Youbora, Googlecast then you need to add it as dependency in your FE app's `build.gradle` or `pod` file for Android and iOS. Latest versions are there in Maven or Cocoapods and mentioned on the Github repos as well.

### Folder Structure

#### `.ios` and `./android` 

It contains the native source code for iOS and Android platforms. We are using our Native SDKs [Kaltura Player Android](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-player-android) and [Kaltura Player iOS](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-player-ios) for this react native SDK.

#### `./src` 

It contains the react native bridge code which constains the APIs which as a React Native FE apps will eventually be calling. It communicates to the relevant platform to call the underlying Native Player (iOS and Android).

#### `./example`

It contains a test app which contains a Test JSON. Currently this JSON has our in house or open media streams. You can pass your media stream URLs or IDs in this JSON and it will be visible in the mobile screen.

### Building the environment (React Native RN)

1. Open the project folder in your favourite IDE. We are giving example here with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) IDE.
2. Stand on the root directory and call `yarn install`. It will fetch all the relevant dependencies in your local machine in `node_modules` root folder.

### Building the environment (Example Test App)

  1. Navigate to `example` folder and call `yarn install`. It will fetch all the relevant dependencies in your local machine under `node_modules` example folder.
  2. Source code for the test app is in `./src` folder.

- #### Setup for Android

  1. Open Android Studio and click on **File** -> **Open** then choose `./example/android` folder.
  2. Let it build. After some time, on left side pane, you should see project files. If there are any build errors, please try to fix it. These build errors could be related to the Android Studio and Gradle version you are using. We suggest to use Android Studio (Dolphin or later version) and Gradle version 7+.
